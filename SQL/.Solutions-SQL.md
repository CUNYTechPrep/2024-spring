# SQL: Structured Query Language Exercise

  
  

For this section of the exercise we will be using the `bigquery-public-data.new_york_311.311_service_requests` table.

  

1. Write a query that tells us how many rows are in the table.

```sql

SELECT 
    COUNT(*) 
FROM 
    `bigquery-public-data.new_york_311.311_service_requests`

```

  

2. Write a query that counts all of the records for just your zip code. (zipcode column is `incident_zip`)

```sql
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as n_cases
FROM 
    `bigquery-public-data.new_york_311.311_service_requests` 
WHERE 
    incident_zip = "11105"
```  

2.2. Lets find out what the most common complaint_type there is in NYC. Write a query that counts all the records for each complaint_type. Hint.. you are going to have to do a group by.  Order them from highest to lowest. 

```sql
  SELECT
      complaint_type,
      COUNT(*) as n
  FROM
      `bigquery-public-data.new_york_311.311_service_requests`
  GROUP BY
      complaint_type
  ORDER BY 
      n DESC    
  ```

3. For every agency, count how many _DISTINCT_ agency_names each one has. Hint you must use a group by for this as well.

```sql
      SELECT
          agency,
          COUNT(DISTINCT agency_name)
      FROM
          `bigquery-public-data.new_york_311.311_service_requests`
      GROUP BY
          agency	
  ```
  

4. What are the 5 agency_names with the most complaints?

	```sql
	SELECT
	  agency_name,
	  COUNT(agency_name) AS n
	FROM
	  `bigquery-public-data.new_york_311.311_service_requests`
	GROUP BY
	  agency_name
	ORDER BY
	  n DESC
	LIMIT
	  5
	  ```

  
  

5. Lets inspect which complaint_type has the most open cases. Write a query that lists and counts all the records for each complaint_type, just for the where the stats is 'Open' and order the results from highest to lowest.   Hint... Limit

```sql

SELECT
  complaint_type,
  COUNT( * ) AS n
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.new_york_311.311_service_requests`
WHERE
  status = 'Open'
GROUP BY
  complaint_type
ORDER BY
  n DESC

```

  
  

6. Write a query to check if there are any duplicate values in the unique_key column (hint.. There are two was to do this, one is to use a temporary table for the groupby, then filter for values that have more than one count, or, using just one table but including the `having` function).

	```sql
	# FIRST WAY TO DO IT USING TEMP TABLE
	WITH T AS (
	  SELECT
	      unique_key,
	      COUNT(unique_key) AS n
	    FROM
	      `bigquery-public-data.new_york_311.311_service_requests`
	    GROUP BY
	      unique_key
	  )
	SELECT * FROM T WHERE n > 1
	```

	```sql
	# SECOND WAY TO DO IT USING HAVING
		SELECT
		  unique_key,
		  COUNT(unique_key) AS n
		FROM
		  `bigquery-public-data.new_york_311.311_service_requests`
		GROUP BY
		  unique_key
		HAVING n > 1
	```
  
  

## For this next section, use the `new_york_citibike` datasets.

  

1. Using the `bigquery-public-data.new_york_citibike.citibike_trips` table, who went on more bike trips, self-identified Males or Females?

	```sql
	# ANSWER IS MALES
	SELECT
	  gender,
	  COUNT(*) AS n_trips
	FROM
	  `bigquery-public-data.new_york_citibike.citibike_trips`
	GROUP BY
	  gender
	```

2. What was the average, shortest, and longest bike trip taken in minutes?

	```sql
	SELECT
	  AVG(tripduration) / 60 AS avg_trip,
	  MIN(tripduration) / 60 AS min_trip,
	  MAX(tripduration) / 60 AS max_trip
	FROM
	  `bigquery-public-data.new_york_citibike.citibike_trips`
	```


  

3. Write a query that, for every station_name, has the amount of trips that started there and the amount of trips that ended there. (Hint, use two temporary tables, one that counts the amount of starts, the other that counts the number of ends, and then join the two and displays each station name, total starts, total ends and the sum total starts and total ends.)

	```sql
    WITH
    TABLE_STARTS AS (
    SELECT
        start_station_name AS station_name,
        COUNT(*) AS n_starts
    FROM
        `bigquery-public-data.new_york_citibike.citibike_trips`
    GROUP BY
        start_station_name),
    TABLE_ENDS AS (
    SELECT
        end_station_name AS station_name,
        COUNT(*) AS n_ends
    FROM
        `bigquery-public-data.new_york_citibike.citibike_trips`
    GROUP BY
        end_station_name)
    SELECT
    *, (n_starts + n_ends) as total
    FROM
    TABLE_STARTS
    JOIN
    TABLE_ENDS
    USING
    (station_name)
	```
  
  
  

## Political Ads

  

1. Using the `bigquery-public-data.google_political_ads.advertiser_weekly_spend` table, Lets find which politican or campaign (`advertiser_name`) is spending the most on political ads **overall**. Using the `advertiser_weekly_spend` table, write a query that lists the advertiser_names that spent the most in usd sort them by the amount the spent highest to lowest.

```

SELECT
  advertiser_name,
  SUM(spend_usd) AS total_spend
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.google_political_ads.advertiser_weekly_spend`
GROUP BY
  advertiser_name
ORDER BY
  total_spend DESC

```

  

2. Do the same thing, but where it is only this year. (look at table schema for which column to use)

```

SELECT
  advertiser_name,
  SUM(spend_usd) AS total_spend
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.google_political_ads.advertiser_weekly_spend`
WHERE
  week_start_date > '2024-02-01'
GROUP BY
  advertiser_name
ORDER BY
  total_spend DESC

```

  

3. Find what week_start_date had the highest ad spend..?

```

SELECT
  week_start_date,
  SUM(spend_usd) AS total_spend
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.google_political_ads.advertiser_weekly_spend`
GROUP BY
  week_start_date
ORDER BY
  total_spend DESC

```
 
  

### For the next question, use the `census_bureau_usa` tables.

*  `bigquery-public-data.census_bureau_usa.population_by_zip_2000`

*  `bigquery-public-data.census_bureau_usa.population_by_zip_2010`

  

1. Write a query that returns each zipcode and their population for 2000 and 2010. Hint... You are probably going to have to use two temporary tables, then join them.

	```sql
		WITH
		  TABLE_A AS (
		  SELECT
		    zipcode,
		    SUM(population) AS pop_2000
		  FROM
		    `bigquery-public-data.census_bureau_usa.population_by_zip_2000` 
        GROUP BY zipcode),
		  TABLE_B AS (
		  SELECT
		    zipcode,
		    SUM(population) AS pop_2010
		  FROM
		    `bigquery-public-data.census_bureau_usa.population_by_zip_2010` 
        GROUP BY zipcode)
		SELECT
		  A.zipcode,
		  A.pop_2000,
		  B.pop_2010,
		  B.pop_2010 - A.pop_2000 as pop_diff
		FROM
		  TABLE_A AS A
		JOIN
		  TABLE_B AS B
		ON
		  A.zipcode = B.zipcode ORDER BY pop_diff DESC
      ```
